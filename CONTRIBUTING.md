## Credits and Attribution

This project uses **two different ways** of recognizing contributions:

1. **GitHub Contributors**  
   GitHub automatically tracks everyone who has commits merged into the main branch. All changes, however small or big, will appear in GitHub’s [Contributors](https://github.com/hyperfield/yt-channel-downloader/graphs/contributors) tab. This is automatic and requires no action on your part.

2. **Project Credits (e.g. the About dialog)**  
   The credits displayed inside the app or project documentation are curated manually.  
   - Typically included: core maintainers, major feature authors, long-term or repeated contributors.  
   - Typically not included: very small changes such as typo fixes, whitespace cleanups, or single-line edits.
   - This helps keep the in-app/project credits meaningful and fair to all contributors.
