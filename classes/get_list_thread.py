class GetListThread(QThread):
    """
    A thread class for fetching a list of videos from a YouTube channel or
    a single video.

    This class inherits from QThread and is used to retrieve either all
    videos from a given YouTube channel or a single video, based on the
    provided channel ID or video URL. The retrieval process is done in
    a separate thread to avoid blocking the main application.

    Attributes:
    finished (Signal): A signal that is emitted when the video list
                       retrieval is complete.
                       The signal sends a list of videos.

    Parameters:
    channel_id (str): The unique identifier for a YouTube channel.
                      If this is None, the class will fetch a single
                      video using channel_url.
    yt_channel (YTChannel): An instance of the YTChannel class that
                            provides the functionality to fetch
                            video details from YouTube.
    channel_url (str, optional): The URL of a single YouTube video.
                                 This is used only if channel_id is
                                 None. Defaults to None.
    parent (QObject, optional): The parent object of the thread.
                                Defaults to None.
