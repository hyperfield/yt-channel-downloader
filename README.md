## Change Log

### What's New in version 0.5.0

- **More sites!** You can now fetch single tracks or videos from other `yt-dlp`-supported platforms — including Vimeo (requires login), Twitch, SoundCloud, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, Udemy*, and Reddit — directly from the main URL field. (Bulk channel / playlist fetches remain YouTube-only. *Udemy still requires the appropriate credentials/cookies for premium content.)
- **YouTube Login and Logout**: Configure the browser profile whose cookies yt-dlp reuses for private, premium, or age-restricted downloads - no heavy-weight embedded browser anymore. Use `File -> YouTube login` to pick the browser and profile, and clear the configuration from the same menu when you no longer need it.
- **Download cancellation**: Downloads in progress can now be cancelled with the "Cancel downloads" button.
- **Format selection**: Improved the logic.

### What's New in version 0.4.12

- **Only the Windows installer changed**: updated `yt-dlp` to the latest version to fix a problem with unretrievable URLs.

### What's New in version 0.4.11

- **Fixed URL fetching bug**: short YouTube URLs are now fetched.
- **Cleanup**: a minor cleanup in some source files.

### What's New in version 0.4.10

- **Improved stability**: Bug fixes and improved exception handling.
- **Smoother UI**: The interface also got a small facelift with more consistent layouts and widget styles.

### What's New in version 0.4.8

- **FFmpeg installation verification**: Implemented a check for FFmpeg’s presence on the system, as it is required for media downloads. While the Windows installer already handled this by installing FFmpeg if missing, the source code version lacked this verification. (Contributed by [arvinnick](https://github.com/arvinnick)).

### What's New in version 0.4.6

- **Thumbnail downloads**: Added checkbox in Settings to enable thumbnail downloads for each video link. (Contributed by [dsasmblr](https://github.com/dsasmblr)).

### What's New in version 0.4.5

- **Fetch progress dialog**: Added an indefinite progress bar dialog window that displays the elapsed time in seconds and has a Cancel button.
- **Some refactoring**: Added numerous Python docstrings, introduced a new class, and reformatted the code for improved cleanliness and readability.

### What's New in version 0.4.2

- **Shorts support**: Downloading YouTube shorts now works.
- **Improved exception handling**: Improved handling of network and download errors, timeouts.

### What's New in version 0.4.1

- **Bug Fixes**: Due to some updates on YouTube, certain functionality didn't work. The "Any" format selection didn't work. These have been fixed.
- **Improved exception handling**: Some parts of the code needed exception handling.
- **Improved interface**: Better and bigger fonts and buttons.
- **Added the "Donate" item to the Help menu**: In the hope that some will support the author, which motivates faster improvement of the app.

### What's New in version 0.4.0

- **YouTube Login and Logout**: Configure the browser profile whose cookies yt-dlp should reuse for private or age-restricted downloads. Use `File -> YouTube login` to select the browser/profile, and choose “Clear YouTube login” to forget the configuration.
- **Minor Improvements and Bug Fixes**.

### What's New in version 0.3.3

- **Improved default audio track downloading**: the program will now always attempt to download the best available quality audio track. Previously, the associated audio track was not always downloaded, for 4k quality videos in particular.

### What's New in version 0.3.2

- **Fixed the handling of video resolutions and formats specified in Settings**: the program will correctly find the closest available video resolution and format based on user settings, for horizontal and vertical videos.

### What's New in version 0.3.1

- **Limiting of simultaneous download threads**: this improves the responsiveness of the application and optimizes its handling of large download lists.
- **Improved file name sanitation method**: this prevents some completed downloads not being marked as such.

### What's New in version 0.3.0

- **Download playlists**, in addition to channels or single videos
- **Select All** check box: allows to select all non-downloaded videos in a list at once
- **Bug fixes**: improved URL validation, partial download completion
- **Interface improvements**
- **Other improvements**: code cleanup, updated README
